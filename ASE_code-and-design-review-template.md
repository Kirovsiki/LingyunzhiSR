# My Project Title
ArbSR and SR in video
## Abstract

The resolution is an increase in image information to improve clear artificial intelligence. The fuzzy image of a low discrimination rate is commonly used to enlarge the image through the algorithm. (2017) because of the study of artificial intelligence in the post-continued study. One of the steps that the resolution will be a step in this project becomes the goal of the research.
SRCNN is the original algorithm of Super Resolution; The mapping is represented as a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that takes the low-resolution image as the input and outputs the high-resolution one. (2015) SRCNN is a convolutional neural network (2016), which uses bicubic interpolation to magnify the low-resolution image to the target size, then fits the nonlinear mapping through the three-layer convolutional network, and finally outputs the high-resolution image results. However, such processing is too simple. Although the performance is good most of the time, the processing time is too long, and the error rate is high, which is the weakness of this algorithm.
Arbor is a bi-directional image zoomization network with more convolution network processing images. Such a model can also magnify and narrow the learning and improve the performance of the zoom model.(2022) There is no virtual problem after many cycles. This maybe become an effective way of thinking about image processing.However, based on the existing. Single-image sharpening is already complete. But it's a very difficult thing to make the video clear. Therefore, if each key frame of the video can be clear, whether can be a solution. And is there a way to make it automatic?

## Detailed Description

There are several papers describing the original SR model as well as the latest SR model. And through the model of the picture clarity paper and model.
